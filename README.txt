    A modern, blocky portfolio website with a mobile-style menu, fully responsive styling,
    and an assortment of pre-styled elements, designed for showcasing IT admin and digital creator services.
    Here's how it's built:

    - Built using components from HTML5 UP's Spectral theme.
    - It uses flexbox to create a responsive layout without clunky CSS grid systems.
    - It leverages Sass for more efficient styling, incorporating several mixins and functions.
    - The site integrates jQuery for smooth scrolling and interactivity.

    In short, this portfolio is the culmination of several web technologies that allow me to showcase my IT and digital solutions in a user-friendly format.
